# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of historical data of several crowdfunding campaigns aiming diferent types of projects from around the world trought different years. For this particular analysis, we focused on theater plays around the world and if they were succesful according to the launch month for the campaign, and also, how does the outcomes relate to the monetary goal. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the best month to launch a crowfunding campaing and to set the optimal monetary goal to fund a theater play in order to maximize the probability of success as an outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges
For this particular challenge what I found to be the most dificult was the correct interpretation of what was required, the background invites you to consider a filter by country 
it´s even required for the  but we are not asked to actually filter by country, even thougth we kind of know that the project is going to be launched in the US or maybe UK because of the previous activities and that was confusing. 

I still dont get why in the interpretation in the modules we can clearly see that the highest succes outcomes come in May > The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 
and then it says that the succes outcomes tendency starts in June, That was super confusing and I came to the conclusión that it was a mistake of some kind. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
